#### Description

This is a project for the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding, where given a starter code and source images, a PacMan figure is animated and moves across the screen, turning around when the boundary is detected



#### How to Run

Once the page loads the animation should begin and continue on its own


#### Roadmap of Future Improvements

More functionality can be added; buttons and other design elements can be added; more PacMen and related characters
